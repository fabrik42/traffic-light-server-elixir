* Traffic Light Server
This is a small Elixir server with the purpose to configure and serve a light configuration to a real traffic light, like this one:

It is meant to be used with a corresponding client to read the light and do something awesome with it.

An example is [[https://github.com/fabrik42/traffic-light-client-elixir][a client running on a Raspberry PI]] that fetches the light configuration of this app and displays it on a real traffic light.

It features the following capabilities:
- LiveView-powered web UI to view a virtual traffic light
- JSON API to connect a real traffic light client
- Webhook API to receive status updates from CI services like [[https://documentation.codeship.com/general/projects/notifications/][Codeship]].
- Interactive "public" mode where you can control the traffic light with the web UI.
* Light Modes
When in =public= mode, the light configuration can be changed by clicking on the corresponding lights on the UI.

In =ci= mode the web UI is read-only and only shows the current status.

Just change the heroku env variable like this =heroku config:set LIGHT_MODE=public=, heroku will automatically restart your app and the new light mode is applied.
* JSON API

#+begin_src restclient
GET http://localhost:4000/lights
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{
  "green": true,
  "mode": "public",
  "red": false,
  "yellow": false
}
#+END_SRC
* Webhook API
Example for a webhook for codeship (the only supported webooks right now):

#+begin_src restclient
POST http://localhost:4000/webhooks/codeship?token=MY-SECRET-CI-TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "build": {
    "build_url":"https://www.codeship.com/projects/10213/builds/973711",
    "commit_url":"https://github.com/codeship/docs/ commit/96943dc5269634c211b6fbb18896ecdcbd40a047",
    "project_id":10213,
    "build_id":973711,
    "status":"success",
    "project_full_name":"codeship/docs",
    "project_name":"codeship/docs",
    "commit_id":"96943dc5269634c211b6fbb18896ecdcbd40a047",
    "short_commit_id":"96943",
    "message":"Merge pull request #34 from codeship/feature/shallow-clone",
    "committer":"beanieboi",
    "branch":"master"
  }
}
#+end_src
* Development
Start server with

#+begin_src sh
iex -S mix phx.server
#+end_src
* Deploy on Heroku
Install the Heroku Redis addon. This will also provide you with the =REDIS_URL= environment variable.

Make sure all other required environment variables have been set by you using =heroku config=.

#+begin_src sh
heroku config:set CI_SECRET=YOURSECRET
heroku config:set LIGHT_MODE=public
heroku config:set DASHBOARD_AUTH_USERNAME=ADMIN
heroku config:set DASHBOARD_AUTH_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
#+end_src

Open a new iex console on Heroku.

#+begin_src sh
heroku run iex -S mix
#+end_src

Setup some initial data for each mode:

#+begin_src elixir
ls = TrafficLight.LightSetting.build(mode: "ci")
TrafficLight.LightSetting.save(ls, "ci")
ls = TrafficLight.LightSetting.build(mode: "public")
TrafficLight.LightSetting.save(ls, "public")
#+end_src
